# 🍽️ Daily UI Kitchen

My journey to becoming the Carmy of frontend.  
One handcrafted UI dish every day.  
The goal is to make each dish (UI) pixel-perfect from figma to code.

Things i need to remember and improve

- resetting default elements that have padding and margin
- "float left" can be used to make the other child element to be relative to the parent.
- use "background image + position + " for inserting images or icons into special elements like button and input
- use "background image" for inserting images into the divs so that we can insert text above the layout.
- remember to reset html ,body , #root {height : 100% ; margin: 0;}

Things i need to remember

- to add another font family from google to react, we have to add it in index.js header 
- span can be used with id to seperate the design from the original p tag
- have to improve on background image / image in a container like contain / cover ...
- need to improve on container like planning what code to write for this container
