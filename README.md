My journey to becoming the Carmy of frontend.  
One handcrafted UI dish every day.

Things i need to remember

- resetting default elements that have padding and margin
- "float left" can be used to make the other child element to be relative to the parent.
- use "background image + position + " for inserting images or icons into special elements like button and input
- use "background image" for inserting images into the divs so that we can insert text above the layout.
- remember to reset html ,body , #root {height : 100% ; margin: 0;}
